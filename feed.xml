STOP NOW IF YOU DON’T WISH TO BE SPOILED!!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just got back from seeing Star Wars Episode VIII: The Last Jedi and …. WOW!!! I absolutely love this movie. It’s right up there in the franchise, definitely top 3. It was a polarizing movie, and after spending time reading people’s reasons for disliking it online, I think I can understand where they’re coming from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I respectfully disagree with their opinion… Strongly disagree. In fact, there were really only two things that bothered me about this movie, so I’ll cover those first:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Why have Jedi Master Luke milk this weird… Thing? Honestly it was a little gross, and totally unnecessary to the story.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The humor at times seemed a bit forced (haha, puns), and marvel-ish. Most of the humor was very good, but I think they could have pulled back during some of the more serious moments.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, as to why I think this movie was so polarizing? I really think it comes down to &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; you like Star Wars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Original Trilogy was heavily based around the archetypal hero’s journey. All the characters are there, you have Luke, the nobody from nowhere who discovers he’s a somebody with a very important ancestry and destined to save the Galaxy. You have Obi-Wan, who’s the old hermit wizard who trains the boy, and (literally) disappears when it’s time for the boy to stand on his own. You have the selfish jerk who eventually learns to care for other people and becomes a hero in his own right. And you have the funny characters that still move the plot along. All the parts are there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Prequel Trilogy was a bit… Different. While it has many faults in regards to poor dialogue, very annoying characters, and many other poor choices from a critic-of-film standpoint, as a story it was good. It had a lot going for it, and it really added to the Star Wars cannon. But, it was different. Really different. People didn’t want different, not like this. You have Anakin, who’s this hero, but falls. His mentor is unable to guide him well enough. The Jedi order, instead of being this holy, incorruptible order of wisdom, turns to war and lets their greatest enemy gain power right under their nose. Much of what we know about Star Wars is challenged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now, you have the Sequel Trilogy. It is also quite a bit different. Instead of having archetypes, or anti-archetypes, we have un-archetypes. Rey turns out to have no important parentage (unless you are of the mindset that Kylo/Ben lied, which is a very high possibility). Luke turns out to have failed, but in a final show of immense force-power seeks to teach Ben Solo one final lesson. Kylo turns on his master, but instead of being a big side-change it’s a power grab.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything about this movie completely changes your expectations. If you’re in it for the nostalgia (which means you likely love the Original Trilogy and hate the prequels), there’s a good chance you might not have liked this movie. That’s okay. If you thought episode VII seemed too much like a remake, but still wanted more of the archetypes, you might not like this movie either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for me? I love the fresh perspective it brings on not just the Star Wars universe, but on my view of humanity as a whole. Rey is an example of how where you come from doesn’t have to define your destiny. In a world where people are turning back to their race, political party, and sex as the source of their identity, in this movie her character chooses to let go of all that and pursue a path forward, letting go of the past. Or is it? Episode IX might have other ideas, and that’s okay. I look forward to seeing what those are!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="blog" /><summary type="html">SPOILERS AHEAD!!!

I’ve observed on these sites that a large amount of people think one can’t be both religious and scientific. Adherence to a religious belief instantly discredits you from anything you have to say because you’re “delusional” and/or a “science-denier”. I will attempt to argue that this is most certainly not the case, and that one can practice religion (in my case Christianity) while still being scientific. One must simply understand the scope of both.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-purpose-of-science-and-religion&quot;&gt;The purpose of Science and Religion&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Science and Religion are both tools for discovering truth. The truths they reveal are fundamentally different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For purposes of this argument, I will define science as anything discovered through proper use of the scientific method. The scientific method contains several steps:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ask a question&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Create a hypothesis (or a well-researched guess)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Design a procedure to test the hypothesis, attempting to remove as many extra variables as possible&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use evidence from the procedure to arrive at a conclusion about the hypothesis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These steps have been designed to tell us truths about the physical, testable, world. Christianity on the other hand tells us truths about the spiritual world, as well as a few truths about the physical world. It is these physical truths that many site as reasons to disqualify the Bible, but what I don’t think they take into account are the fundamental limits of the scientific method, and the intended purpose for some of the religious truths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-assumptions-of-science&quot;&gt;The assumptions of Science&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with the scientific method is that in order to work, it makes two assumptions, which are vital to understand when considering the broad picture:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Everything can be explained through examination and testing of the physical world. For the purposes of Science anything outside the physical world doesn’t exist.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The laws of nature and the physical world have never changed nor will they ever change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Science makes these assumptions by necessity. If a scientist factors the metaphysical into experiments, that allows for an infinite amount of variables and explanations. Why did the apple fall to the ground? Easy, a metaphysical force wanted it to happen so it did. Or maybe the apple’s spirit wanted to be &lt;em&gt;with&lt;/em&gt; the ground. Obviously those conclusions aren’t very useful, nor are they testable. This is why when performing science, one must understand that they cannot account for the metaphysical, and as such any evidence they gather is under that assumption. It isn’t a bad assumption. I’d argue it’s a very useful assumption for the purposes that science usually has - that is, to discover things about the natural world that can be harnessed by mankind for good (or evil).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second assumption science makes is that the laws of the physical world are immutable. This is also out of necessity for many of the same reasons as the first assumption are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key to all of this is understanding that these assumptions &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; in place when doing science. Once this is understood, one can more accurately use the knowledge gained through this method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;reconciling-science-with-the-bible&quot;&gt;Reconciling Science with the Bible&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The origin of the universe and humanity is one of the most polarizing issues, both between different groups of Christians and between Christians and Atheists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe the solution to this problem is to recognize that science is most accurate when telling us about the present time, and any claims made about the pre-recorded past are subject to those two assumptions I mentioned earlier. I’m not suggesting we throw out all of those findings, but I am saying one can be a scientist or an intellectual and choose to disbelieve some of them. It just depends on which method one prefers for delivering truth. I’ve seen Science to be wrong quite often in the past, but many of the events predicted in the Bible have come to pass, and I personally choose to believe in the Bible when it indisputably clashes with scientific findings about the past. My actual beliefs regarding the age of the earth and how humanity came to be are quite nuanced, and I don’t want to cause a fight in the comment section, so I won’t discuss those here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-usefulness-of-biblical-statements-on-the-physical-world&quot;&gt;The usefulness of Biblical statements on the physical world&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the Bible contains some statements about the universe that may be at odds with Science, It also contains commandments that align with Scientific findings, but are presented for different purposes. One of the easiest examples to see is in mosaic law regarding dietary restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;God tells the Jews not to eat meat with blood still in it. We know through scientific findings that raw meat can be dangerous to consume due to germs which have congregated in the meat since the animal has been dead. The Jews didn’t have germ theory, but God was able to help protect them with that law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We know today that certain types of meat are relatively safe to consume uncooked, and many modern day Christians enjoy rare steak. I believe God gave the Jews this dietary restriction for the additional purpose of unification and separation. He wanted His people to be distinct from the rest of the world, and dietary restrictions are a very effective way to do that. We see this purpose in most of the other ceremonial laws as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both Science and the Bible can teach us truths about the world. It’s important to understand the purpose and limitations of both in order to arrive at what’s true.&lt;/p&gt;

God is perfect. Somehow he loves us when we’re definitely, definitely not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I fell pretty hard into an old sin habit the other day, as we’re all prone to do. Of course, once I fully realized what I had done I felt terrible, since it’s one of those sin habits that just doesn’t want to go away. I was praying to God asking for forgiveness, etc. when the full extent of his grace dawned on me. I remembered two things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, it’s a relationship, but since one of us is perfect and the other is far from it, it’s really an abusive relationship. We’re the abuser. Think about that for a sec.
&lt;strong&gt;It’s an abusive relationship in which &lt;em&gt;we&lt;/em&gt; are the abuser.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why does God continue to stay in this abusive relationship? It’s certainly not good for us to stay in those kinds of relationships. I think it’s because of how perfect and good God is. He can’t be dragged down by us. We add nothing to him, we take nothing from him. His grace just overflows into us. Through Jesus’ death on the cross, we’re saved from the penalty to our sin and somehow God is able to not only tolerate us, but love us and &lt;em&gt;enjoy&lt;/em&gt; us through it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;God is also our father, and he gives great gifts as he says. There’s an analogy I once heard somewhere that I will expound apon slightly, which is the other thing I remembered after I fell again:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine a father who, being incredibly wealthy, gives his son a sports car. The son loves the car, and loves to drive it, but sometimes he get’s a bit rowdy. Perhaps he’s just really had a rough day, or he’s feeling that teenage angst that we’ve all felt at one point. He drives a bit too fast, takes a turn a bit too fast, and crashes into a pole. He gets the car fixed, nobody is hurt, but it’s still pretty rough. One would think that he would learn from this and drive carefully, but instead, when his dad purchases a new car, he does it again, except this time going even faster. He thinks to himself “I can control it this time! I’m a better driver than I was then!”. Of course, he’s lying to himself. While he may be a better driver, he’s really just intoxicated with the adrenaline, the anger that he feels, the pain, whatever’s going on, that he crashes again, this time almost hurting someone in the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet his dad fixes the car for him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This happens several more times, each time increasing in damage. He totals the car several times, but his dad gives him new ones each time. His dad is fully aware of how his son will handle the car, but believes that eventually he will learn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The analogy starts to &lt;em&gt;break down&lt;/em&gt; here (haha puns), but I think it can be useful to think about God this way. He’s given us something, which we continue to abuse and hurt ourselves and sometimes others with, and while we have to live with the consequences of our actions, he is graceful and merciful in how he repairs the damage we caused, and helps us grow along the way.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="blog" /><summary type="html">God is amazing.
