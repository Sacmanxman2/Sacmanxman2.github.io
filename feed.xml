&lt;p&gt;So, I suppose this is the first post I’ll ever make. I’ve decided to make this site as an outlet for various thoughts I have, and to create a place for discussion regarding those. I plan to put some sort of comments system on here, but we’ll see what I can do. I may just recommend responding to what I put on here on your own blog, as I plan to respond to others here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from various rants and articles to discuss, I’ll occasionally be doing various productivity experiments and trying various things, all of which I’ll put on here for your entertainment!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Mandatory First Post</summary></entry></feed>
