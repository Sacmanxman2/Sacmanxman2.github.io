  <h1>I'm reading books a lot now!</h1>
</div><span class="article-wrapper">
  <article class="content"><p>So lately, I’ve taken to reading a lot. I always have enjoyed reading books, but recently my interest and time spent doing it has increased significantly. Don’t be concerned, I’m not an addict. Please don’t call my Mom.</p>

<p>Of course, being as ADHD as I am (officially actually, as of my childhood anyway), I can’t just read one book, so I’m in the middle of several. Here they are, in no particular order:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Inception and Philosophy: Because It’s Never Just a Dream</em> by David Kyle Johnson</li>
  <li><em>Dune</em> by Frank Herbert</li>
  <li><em>12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos</em> by Jordan Peterson</li>
  <li><em>Knowing God</em> by J.I. Packer</li>
  <li><em>The Bible</em> by God (It might take me a while to review this one, there’s a lot going on here)</li>
</ul>

<p>No, I’m not actually going to review the Bible. Who am I to do that anyway, that’s almost blasphemous just to think about.</p>

<p>And Here is my Master book list. All the books I want to read. It’s growing quite a bit. Some of the books are novels, others are non-fiction/philosophy, and others are a bit of the educational/self-help variety. Some of the novels are classics, Sci-Fi, Fantasy, and some of them are just for fun.</p>

<p>Some of these books are pretty hard reads. Until recently it seems, most novels had a TON of description, with lots of flowery language. I like myself a well constructed sentence, but when it’s so long I have to struggle to remember the beginning of it, that’s a bit much. I’m exaggerating a bit here, and since your mind is like a muscle I hope to get better at all this, but just in case for now, I will occasionally supplement my reading with SparkNotes or something similar, to make sure I don’t get lost. This isn’t cheating, it’s using your resources, as they say. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180205232255/https://i.pinimg.com/736x/42/c4/d8/42c4d80a29f7848043b9996769c4a700.jpg">Who are the <em>they</em> anyway?</a></p>
