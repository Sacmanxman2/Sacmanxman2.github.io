        <h2>Dune Review</h2>
        <p><p>I finished reading <em>Dune</em> by Frank Herbert roughly a week ago, but haven’t had time to do a full review until now, so here it goes… Spoilers ahead if you haven’t read it!</p>

        <h2>I'm reading books a lot now!</h2>
        <p><p>So lately, I’ve taken to reading a lot. I always have enjoyed reading books, but recently my interest and time spent doing it has increased significantly. Don’t be concerned, I’m not an addict. Please don’t call my Mom.</p>

        <h2>Star Wars VIII: The Last Jedi - SPOILER REVIEW</h2>
        <p><p><em>Update Feb. 2018:</em> I have discussed some of the film further with some friends who strongly disliked it, and while I still think it is a great film, I think my initial reaction to people disliking it so much was quite over simplified. I’ll leave it below, but know that I do see some ways the film might have been better, or a better Star Wars film, and that if you hold those opinions, more power to you! Having said all that, I still take issue with people saying it’s objectively bad, or an objectively bad Star Wars film, and it’s still among my favorites.</p>

        <h2>Why Science and Christianity aren't at odds</h2>
        <p><p>I spend a lot of time on the internet, especially on sites like reddit and YouTube. I’ve observed on these sites that a large amount of people think one can’t be both religious and scientific. Adherence to a religious belief instantly discredits you from anything you have to say because you’re “delusional” and/or a “science-denier”. I will attempt to argue that this is most certainly not the case, and that one can practice religion (in my case Christianity) while still being scientific. One must simply understand the scope of both.</p>

        <h2>Mandatory First Post!</h2>
        <p><p>So, I suppose this is the first post I’ll ever make. I’ve decided to make this site as an outlet for various thoughts I have, and to create a place for discussion regarding those. I plan to put some sort of comments system on here, but we’ll see what I can do. I may just recommend responding to what I put on here on your own blog, as I plan to respond to others here.</p>
