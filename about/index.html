  <h1>About Jared</h1>
</div><span class="article-wrapper">
  <article class="content"><p>Jared Sackett is a Christian, Free &amp; Open Source Software (FOSS) advocate, general computer nerd, and a bunch of other things.</p>

<p>What does all that mean you ask?</p>

<p>Well, I’m a Christian because I have a personal relationship with Jesus Christ that sorta defines a lot of how I look at life and do my best to live it. I’m really bad at it, but by the grace of God I’m getting better!</p>

<p>Since at least late Elementary school, I’ve been fascinated with computers. I helped run a few clubs after school in middle school, and always tinkered with stuff. I specifically have been messing with Linux since middle school (Ubuntu 9.10 Karmic Koala for those that are interested), and currently use Arch Linux as my daily driver (<a href="../images/Arch-linux-meme-4-LXLE-linux.jpg">Did I mention I use Arch?</a> <a href="../images/LinuxFuneral.jpg">I do</a>). I also have begun to really advocate for consumer privacy, security, and basically freedom to use their devices how they wish. This includes things like the right to repair, Net Neutrality, and creating awareness of how many big tech companies build back doors and DRM into things.</p>

<p>I also really enjoy playing and listening to music. I play the piano, bass, and percussion/drums (although with a lack of drumset I’m a bit out of practice). My favorite bands would be Snarky Puppy, Relient K, Boston, and Dirty Loops, but I like a variety. Jazz Fusion, Christian Punk Rock/Ska, Classic Rock, EDM, and Funk are my favorite styles.</p>

<p>I often quote the Bible, CS Lewis, Star Wars, and the Lord of the Rings, among other things. The references are often obscure, so if you ever catch me… Good job! (See what I did there? No? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izB1ZzAGfEU">Here’s a link</a>). Also, I like memes. A lot.</p>
